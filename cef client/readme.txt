New lobby client is built on Chromium Embedded Framework(CEF).
You can extract wad files but you can't modify them (need to be singed by riot private key).
You can accomplish this by Modifying data and executive in memory in theory.
But I don't do that here (not allowed in github and lack of knowledges).

What are done now:

Making lobby partial English, you can pick by English champions name.



Lobby_eng.cmd LoLTW [LoLTW root directory]
	You can run Lobby_eng.cmd anywhere. Current direcotry is used if direcotry is not specified.

	ex: Lobby_eng.cmd "C:\GarenaLoLTW"
